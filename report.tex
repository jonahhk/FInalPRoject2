Problems with Processor: 
-MULT/DIV is never asserted to be ready. This causes an infinite stall every time either multiplication or division is carried out. I suspect this is due to error in transferring the MULTDIV module into the Processor module. However, I was not able to find the cause. 
-Error with Branching. When a negative immediate is added to PC, the result is the immediate. I am not sure what the cause of this is, as the adder (in parallel with ALU) seems to be working as intended.
